## About The Project


There are various internal and external factors that affects the prices of stocks. Apart from the
data, these factors can largely impact the stock prices. Also, to improve the accuracy of the
prediction, considering these factors is important. The stock prices fluctuate a lot whenever a
sudden news strikes the market that can affect the financial factors of the stocks. Also, we
have to keep a track on the circulars that are released by SEBI (Security and Exchange board
of India) as they can directly affect the market trend. Various approaches are used to deal
with these problems. We have tried to get prediction of stock price using Twitter. Twitter is
platform where we can get latest tweets and news regarding financial data and internal
management of various companies. All special characters along with the stop words
were removed. Then we have filtered the data and the tweets were divided as negative neutral
and positive depending upon their news.
Also, we have provided the user news stock feed which will display all the financial related
news to the user. So, if a user wants to make his own prediction based on the financial news
manually, then he can make use of the news feed. User can also search for a specific
company to avail all the news.
